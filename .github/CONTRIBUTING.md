## I don't want to read this whole thing I just have a question

> **Note:** As the size of the Radium community remains limited, we keep using github issue system to provide support for users. If you have a question, first try to find a solution in this file, then browse the existing issues, and, if you still need support, open a new issue stating your problem.

## What should I know before I get started?

Check Radium-Engine's [README](https://github.com/STORM-IRIT/Radium-Engine) and documentation about [concepts](https://storm-irit.github.io/Radium-Engine/master/conceptsmanual.html) and [basics](https://storm-irit.github.io/Radium-Engine/master/basicsmanual.html)

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Radium. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined which component your bug is related to (e.g. [Radium Libraries](#radium-libraries) or [Radium Applications and Plugins](#radium-applications-and-plugins) ), create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you compiled Radium, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, if you used the libraries or packages applications. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem, when it relates to GUI and applications. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **If you're reporting that Radium crashed**, include a crash report with a stack trace from the operating system. On macOS, the crash report will be available in `Console.app` under "Diagnostic and usage information" > "User diagnostic reports".
Include the crash report in the issue in a [code block](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines), a [file attachment](https://help.github.com/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests/), or put it in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) and provide link to that gist.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Can you reproduce the problem**
* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of Radium) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of Radium?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen?
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
* If the problem is related to working with files (e.g. opening and editing files), **does the problem happen for all files and projects or only some?** Is there anything else special about the files you are using? If the files are not too large, add them to your report.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of Radium are you using?** When Radium starts, it prints the current git commit sha1, please add it to your report alongside the git branch used.
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?
* **What's the name and version of the compiler you're using**?
* **Are you running Radium in a virtual machine?** If so, which VM software are you using and which operating systems and versions are used for the host and the guest?
* **Which [plugins](#radium-applications-and-plugins) do you have installed?** Radium Main App prints the list of loaded plugins when starting.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Radium, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion). Fill in [the template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md), including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

* **Determine which Radium component the enhancement should be suggested in ([Libraries](#radium-libraries) or [Applications and Plugins](#radium-applications-and-plugins) ).**
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/search?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3Astorm-irit)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined which repository your enhancement suggestion is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of Radium which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Radium users.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Radium? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues](https://github.com/STORM-IRIT/Radium-Engine/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abeginner) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/STORM-IRIT/Radium-Engine/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)- issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### Pull Requests

* Fill in [the required template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
* Do not include issue numbers in the PR title
* Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible.
* Follow the [coding convention](https://storm-irit.github.io/Radium-Engine/master/develCodingConvention.html)
* Document new code based on the [Documentation Styleguide](#documentation-styleguide)
* Avoid platform-dependent code

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Start commit message with a tag to identify main modified components, e.g. [core], [doc], [tests], [engine], [cmake], [github]
* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* When only changing documentation, include `[ci skip]` in the commit title
* Consider setting github labels to help sorting

### Documentation Styleguide
