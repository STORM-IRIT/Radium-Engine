/** @brief This class allows tasks to be registered and then executed in parallel on separate
 * threads.
 *
 * It maintains an internal pool of threads. When instructed, it dispatches the tasks to the
 * pooled threads.
 * Task are allowed to have dependencies. A task will be executed only when all its dependencies
 * are satisfied, i.e. all dependant tasks are finished.
 * Note that most functions are not thread safe and must not be called when the task queue is
 * running.
 * Typical usage:
\code
    TaskQueue taskQueue( 4 );
    auto task = std::make_unique<FunctionTask>( ... );
    auto tid = taskQueue.registerTask( std::move( task ) );
    // [...]
    taskQueue.addDependency( tid, ... );
    // [...]
    taskQueue.startTasks();
    taskQueue.waitForTasks();
    taskQueue.flushTaskQueue();
\endcode
