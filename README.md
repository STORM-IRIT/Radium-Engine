# Radium-Engine libraries

![banner](doc/images/radium-banner.webp)

Radium is a research 3D Engine for rendering, animation and processing.
It is developed and maintained by the [STORM research group](https://www.irit.fr/STORM/site/).

Radium-Engine comes in two flavors:

- the stable [https://github.com/STORM-IRIT/Radium-Engine/tree/master](master) branch.
- the unstable bleeding edge [https://github.com/STORM-IRIT/Radium-Engine/tree/release-candidate](release-candidate) branch.

The Radium ecosystem is composed of

- **Radium Libraries**: this project (see documentation here: <https://storm-irit.github.io/Radium-Engine/>).
  Contains the Radium libraries.
- **Radium Apps** (<https://github.com/STORM-IRIT/Radium-Apps>): contains several applications, including MainApp,
  which is for now the default software with GUI. This repository also demonstrates command-line applications.
- **Radium Releases** (<https://github.com/STORM-IRIT/Radium-Releases>): meta-repository generating precompiled binaries
  for Radium libraries and its applications.
- **Radium Plugins Example** (<https://github.com/STORM-IRIT/Radium-PluginExample>): contains plugins examples,
  demonstrating how to write, compile and use plugins with MainApp.
- **Radium Official Plugins** (<https://gitlab.com/Storm-IRIT/radium-official-plugins>): general purpose plugins.

## Which repository should I use ?

Depending on you needs, you may want to:

- Use Radium as a viewer and processing software, with graphical user interface.
  That's the most simple case: simply download the latest release, and run.
  See <https://github.com/STORM-IRIT/Radium-Releases/releases>.
- Contribute to Radium, or develop your own application of plugin:
  **Radium Libraries** is the default and mandatory repository you need to fetch first.
  If you only want to _use_ Radium, compile and install it (see [documentation](https://storm-irit.github.io/Radium-Engine/)).
  Then,
      - If you want to contribute to the application or plugins developments, fetch and compile the **Radium Apps** and
        **Radium Official Plugins** respectively.
      - If you want to write your own application of plugin, checkout the
        [HelloRadium](https://github.com/STORM-IRIT/Radium-Apps/tree/fix-compilation/HelloRadium) and
        **Radium Plugins Example** projects.
