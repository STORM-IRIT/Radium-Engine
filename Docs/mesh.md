# Radium Engine 3D objects (a.k.a. Meshes)

## Mesh types
There is three types of meshes included in radium source :
1. `TriangleMesh`
2. `TopologicalMesh`
3. `Mesh`

1. `TriangleMesh` handles geometry data and connectivity as a indexed vertex array. 
Each vertices is a unique set of position, normal, and every attrib.
Faces defined with two vector of indices, one for triangles and one for other type of faces.
This class handles data only, in a way suitable for rendering.
2. `TopologicalMesh` is an half-edge data structure, a converter allows to go back and forth to `TriangleMesh` without loss of data, but during the convertion, vertices with the same position represents the same topological point (and are hence merged). The other vertex attribs are stored on halfedges (to manage multiple normals per 3D positions for instance).
3. `Mesh` has a `TriangleMesh` to handle 3D data, and manage the rendering aspect of a `TriangleMesh` (VAO, VBO, draw call).


## Mesh creation
`FancyMesh` is in charge of loading a `GeometryData` and create the corresponding `Mesh`.

The user can add on the fly new vertex attributes via the `VertexAttribManager` (accessible with `Mesh::attribManager()`).
An attrib is defined by a unique name (`std::string`) and then represented as a `VertexAttribHandle<T>`.
The type of the attrib is defined by the caller using the template parameter of the method `addAttrib`.
To ensure consistency, it is strongly recommended to store the handle returned by the `addAttrib` method:
```
        auto handle1 = m.attribManager().addAttrib<Vector3>( "vector3_attrib" );
```
Note that handles of existing attributes can be retrieved by name (see `getAttrib(const std::string& name)`), however the caller have to provide the type of the associate attribute. 
There is no type check on this access, and we recommend not to use this. We keep this method for convenience in some specific cases such as copy of attributes, however note that it might be marked as deprecated at any time.

There is no (in the current version) data checking, and attribs are simple `std::vector` added to the attrib manager. It's meant to be used as vector of data as vertices and normals, with the same size and accessed with the faces indices. But please be aware no check nor allocation are done, so the allocation has to be performed on client side.

When copying a `TriangleMesh`, only a shallow copy of its attributes is performed to fasten functions return.
In order to perform a deep copy of some/all of the attributes, the dedicated methods must be used (directly using the `AttribManager` is highly discouraged).

For instance
```
        TriangleMesh m;
        m.vertices().push_back( {0, 0, 0} );
        m.vertices().push_back( {1, 0, 0} );
        m.vertices().push_back( {0, 2, 0} );
        m.normals().push_back( {0, 0, 1} );
        m.normals().push_back( {0, 0, 1} );
        m.normals().push_back( {0, 0, 1} );
        m.m_triangles.push_back( {0, 1, 2} );

        auto handle1 = m.attribManager().addAttrib<Vector3>( "vector3_attrib" );
        m.attribManager().getAttrib( handle1 ).data().reserve( 3 );
        m.attribManager().getAttrib( handle1 ).data().push_back( {1, 1, 1} );
        m.attribManager().getAttrib( handle1 ).data().push_back( {2, 2, 2} );
        m.attribManager().getAttrib( handle1 ).data().push_back( {3, 3, 3} );

        VertexAttribHandle<float> handle2 =
        m.attribManager().addAttrib<float>( "float_attrib" );
        auto attrib2 = m.attribManager().getAttrib( handle2 );
        attrib2.data().assign( { 1.f, 2.f, 3.f } );
        
        TriangleMesh m2;
        m2.partialCopy( m, handle1 );
```
