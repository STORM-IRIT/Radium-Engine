# Geometry types
There is three kind of geometry representation included in radium source :
 1. Ra::Core::Geometry::*, which handles geometry data and connectivity as a indexed vertex array.
Each vertex is a unique set of position, normal, and other attributes.
If indexed, faces are defined with VectorXui, where X is 1 for point, 2 for lines, 3 for triangles, and N for polygons.
See inheritance diagram of Ra::Core::Geometry::AbstractGeometry :
   - Ra::Core::Geometry::AttribArrayGeometry
   - Ra::Core::Geometry::IndexedGeometry
   - Ra::Core::Geometry::LineStrip *
   - Ra::Core::Geometry::PointCloud *
   - Ra::Core::Geometry::IndexedPointCloud *
   - Ra::Core::Geometry::LineMesh *
   - Ra::Core::Geometry::TriangleMesh *
   - Ra::Core::Geometry::PolyMesh *

 2. Ra::Core::Geometry::TopologicalMesh, which is an half-edge data structure. 
A converter allows to go back and forth to `TriangleMesh`
without loss of data, but during the conversion, vertices with the same position represents the same topological point (and are hence merged). 
**Soon deprecated:** The other vertex attributes are stored on half-edges (to manage multiple normals per 3D positions
for instance).
**New:** The other vertex attributes are stored on wedges. Each half-edge has one wedge index. If multiple half-edge have the same set of attributes (including vertex position) they have the same wedge index at construction. See section [wedges](#wedges) below.

 3. Ra::Engine::Data::*, which stores a Core Geometry to handle 3D data, and manages the rendering aspect of it (VAO, VBO, draw call).
See inheritance diagram of Ra::Engine::Data::AttribArrayDisplayable
   - Ra::Engine::Data::Displayable
   - Ra::Engine::Data::AttribArrayDisplayable
   - Ra::Engine::Data::CoreGeometryDisplayable

   - Ra::Engine::Data::IndexedGeometry
   - Ra::Engine::Data::IndexedAttribArrayDisplayable
   - Ra::Engine::Data::LineMesh *
   - Ra::Engine::Data::Mesh *
   - Ra::Engine::Data::PolyMesh *
   
 `*` : the starred classes are the one you want to instanciate, the other are more for code factoring or abstraction.
   
# Colaboration between Core and Engine

A Core Geometry can be used on its own.

Engine Geometry must own a Core Geometry, either set at construction, or later with loadGeometry.
The Core Geometry ownership is then transfered to the Engine Geometry, and can be accessed by reference with Ra::Engine::Data::Displayable::getAbstractGeometry or Ra::Engine::Data::CoreGeometryDisplayable::getCoreGeometry


# Data consistency
As soon as a Core Geometry is owned by a Engine Geometry, each data update on the Core Geometry attribute trigger a observator method to mark the corresponding GPU data as dirty.
On the next Ra::Engine::Data::CoreGeometryDisplayable::updateGL, the dirty data will be updated on the GPU.

# Mesh creation
`GeometryComponent` is in charge of loading a `GeometryData` and create the corresponding `Mesh`.

The user can add on the fly new vertex attributes to a Ra::Core::Geometry::AttribArrayGeometry
An attribute is defined by a unique name (std::string) and then represented as a Ra::Core::Utils::AttribHandle.
The type of the attribute is defined by the caller using the template parameter of the method  Ra::Core::Geometry::AttribArrayGeometry::addAttrib.
To ensure consistency, it is strongly recommended to store the handle returned by the Ra::Core::Geometry::AttribArrayGeometry::addAttrib method:
~~~{.cpp}
        auto handle1 = m.addAttrib<Vector3>( "vector3_attrib" );
~~~
Attribute names `in_position` and `in_normals` are reserved.
Note that handles to existing attributes can be retrieved by name (see Ra::Core::Geometry::AttribArrayGeometry::getAttrib), however
the caller have to provide the type of the associate attribute.
There is no type check on this access, and we recommend not to use this. We keep this method for convenience in some
specific cases such as copy of attributes, however note that it might be marked as deprecated at any time.

There is no (in the current version) data checking, and attributes are simple `std::vector`s added to the attribute
manager. It's meant to be used as vector of data, such as vertices and normals, with the same size and accessed with
the vertices indices. But please be aware no check nor allocation are done, so the allocation has to be performed on
client side.

When copying a Ra::Core::Geometry::AttribArrayGeometry or one of its descendent class, all its attributes are copied, unless it is done through Ra::Core::Geometry::AttribArrayGeometry::copyBaseGeometry, for which no attribute is copied.
In order to copy some/all of the attributes, the dedicated methods must be used.

Attribute writes must be with "lock" to ensure data syncronisation.
Utility methods are provided for position and normals :

 - Ra::Core::Geometry::IndexedGeometry::setIndices
 - Ra::Core::Geometry::IndexedGeometry::getIndicesWithLock
 - Ra::Core::Geometry::IndexedGeometry::indicesUnlock
 - Ra::Core::Geometry::AttribArrayGeometry::setVertices
 - Ra::Core::Geometry::AttribArrayGeometry::verticesWithLock
 - Ra::Core::Geometry::AttribArrayGeometry::verticesUnlock
 - Ra::Core::Geometry::AttribArrayGeometry::setNormals
 - Ra::Core::Geometry::AttribArrayGeometry::normalsWithLock
 - Ra::Core::Geometry::AttribArrayGeometry::normalsUnlock

Others attributes are written with :
 - Ra::Core::Geometry::AttribArrayGeometry::getAttrib to get an attrib handle
 - Ra::Core::Utils::Attrib::setData to set the data directly 
or
 - Ra::Core::Utils::Attrib::getDataWithLock to get a writable reference to the data array
 - Ra::Core::Utils::Attrib::unlock to release the writable reference

For instance
\snippet unittest/Core/mesh.cpp create TriangleMesh

Other examples are provided in DrawPrimitives.cpp

## Wedges {#wedges}

![Wedge concept in a nutshell.](wedges.svg)

Wedge are built at construction by using CoreMesh vertex index (which are supposed to represent wedges). Vertices with same (exact) position are merged topologically.
The figure above show the basic concept of wedges for the example of vertex with color attribute (same works for normals, texture coordinates or any other attributes).
a) A colored mesh, each vertex can have a different color depending on which face is considered. b) for rendering, vertex are duplicated the needed number of time. Here the center vertex is duplicated three time, while the top right one is duplicated two times. c) But for topological computation, one need to know these vertex are actually the same position, and are modified the same way. d) So the attributes (here color only) are represented as wedges associated with each coherent set of position+attributes. Here the center vertex has three wedges, while the top right vertex has two wedges. e) In the TopologicalMesh implementation, wedges are stored in an array, independently of the topology. Each half-edge has a wedge index. Half-edges that share the same wedge have the same index.
During manipulation, if two wedges become the same (i.e. for the example on the figure, if we recolor the whole mesh using a single color), **they are not merged**.
To merge wedges an explicit call to TopologicalMesh::mergeEqualWedges is needed.
When a wedge is not referenced anymore (because referencing halfedges have been deleted), it is marked for deletation. When one call Ra::Core::Geometry::TopologicalMesh::garbage_collection(), the marked wedges are eventually deleted and halfedges index are updated accordingly.

\todo  TopologicalMesh::mergeEqualWedges

TopologicalMesh methods and types related to wedges: 

- Ra::Core::Geometry::TopologicalMesh::WedgeData the actual wedge data, with one vector array for each of the supported types (float, Vector2, Vector3, Vector4). The order in these arrays follow the names found in getXXXAttribNames referenced below.
- Ra::Core::Geometry::TopologicalMesh::WedgeIndex
- Ra::Core::Geometry::TopologicalMesh::vertex_wedges
- Ra::Core::Geometry::TopologicalMesh::getWedgeData
- Ra::Core::Geometry::TopologicalMesh::setWedgeData
- Ra::Core::Geometry::TopologicalMesh::getVec4AttribNames
- Ra::Core::Geometry::TopologicalMesh::getVec3AttribNames
- Ra::Core::Geometry::TopologicalMesh::getVec2AttribNames
- Ra::Core::Geometry::TopologicalMesh::getFloatAttribNames
- Ra::Core::Geometry::TopologicalMesh::isFeatureVertex
- Ra::Core::Geometry::TopologicalMesh::isFeatureEdge
- Ra::Core::Geometry::TopologicalMesh::getWedgeIndexPph


\warning To delete face, one need to call `Ra::Core::Geometry::TopologicalMesh::delete_face`, not the `OpenMesh` vanilla `delete_face`

\todo make OpenMesh inheritance private.

Use `Ra::Core::Geometry::TopologicalMesh::collapseWedge` to perform halfedge collapse (works on triangle only ...). The following figure show the nasty updates:
