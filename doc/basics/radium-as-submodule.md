[TOC]

## Quick instructions

Radium is now shiped with a cmake package. To get it:

- Get latest release,
- Build from source, and install to the directory of your choice.

Then, to use Radium in your own project, you need to set, at configure time `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/install/or/release/dir/lib/cmake/Radium`
or to define `Radium_DIR=/path/to/install/or/release/dir/lib/cmake/Radium`.

Your `CMakeLists.txt` might then do the following:

~~~cmake
find_package(Radium REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(${target} Radium::Core Radium::Engine Radium::IO Radium::Gui)
~~~

Include directories and link instructions are populated automatically by cmake.

To configure your target install using Radium facilities:

~~~cmake
configure_radium_app(NAME ${target})
~~~

See \ref configure_radium_app for more details

In your source code:

~~~cpp
#include <Core/Math/DualQuaternion.hpp>
~~~

## Detailed instructions

See [CMake setup](\ref cmakeutilities) for detailed doc and Radium's cmake utilies function insights.
